abstract = {Roberts (1959) first introduced the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control scheme. Using simulation to evaluate its properties, he showed that the EWMA is useful for detecting small shifts in the mean of a process. The recognition that an EWMA control scheme can be represented as a Markov chain allows its properties to be evaluated more easily and completely than has previously been done. In this article, we evaluate the properties of an EWMA control scheme used to monitor the mean of a normally distributed process that may experience shifts away from the target value. A design procedure for EWMA control schemes is given. Parameter values not commonly used in the literature are shown to be useful for detecting small shifts in a process. In addition, several enhancements to EWMA control schemes are considered. These include a fast initial response feature that makes the EWMA control scheme more sensitive to start-up problems, a combined Shewhart EWMA that provides protection against both larg...},

abstract = {In Data Exploration platforms, diversification has become an essential method for extracting representative data, which provide users with a concise and meaningful view of the results to their queries. However, the benefits of diversification are achieved at the expense of an additional cost for the post-processing of query results. For high dimensional large result sets, the cost of diversification is further escalated due to massive distance computations required to evaluate the similarity between results. To address that challenge, in this paper we propose the Progressive Data Diversification (pDiverse) scheme. The main idea underlying pDiverse is to utilize partial distance computation to reduce the amount of processed data. Our extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets show that our proposed scheme outperforms existing diversification methods in terms of both I/O and CPU costs.},

Returning relevant yet diverse results to such queries provides users with quick insights into a rather large data space. Meanwhile, search results diversification adds additional cost to an already computationally expensive exploration process. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel diversification scheme called DivIDE, which targets the problem of efficiently diversifying the results of queries posed during data exploration sessions. In particular, our scheme exploits the properties of data diversification functions while leveraging the natural overlap occurring between the results of different queries so that to provide significant reductions in processing costs. Our extensive experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real data sets shows the significant benefits provided by our scheme as compared to existing methods.},

abstract = {Top-k query processing finds a list of k results that have largest scores w.r.t the user given query, with the assumption that all the k results are independent to each other. In practice, some of the top-k results returned can be very similar to each other. As a result some of the top-k results returned are redundant. In the literature, diversi- fied top-k search has been studied to return k results that take both score and diversity into consideration. Most existing solutions on diversified top-k search assume that scores of all the search results are given, and some works solve the diversity problem on a specific problem and can hardly be extended to general cases. In this paper, we study the diversified top-k search problem. We define a general diversified top-k search problem that only considers the similarity of the search results themselves. Since most existing solutions for top-k query processing aim at finding a stop condition in order to stop early without exploring all the search results. We propose a framework, such that most existing solutions for top-k query pro- cessing can be extended easily to handle diversified top-k search, by simply applying three new functions, a sufficient stop condition sufficient(), a necessary stop condition necessary(), and an algo- rithm for diversified top-k search on the current set of generated re- sults, div-search-current(). We give conditions on sufficient() and necessary(), and show that div-search-current() is an NP-Hard problem and can hardly be approximated using greedy algorithms. We propose three new algorithms, namely, div-astar, div-dp, and div-cut to solve the div-search-current() problem. div-astar is an Aâˆ— based algorithm, div-dp is an algorithm that decomposes the re- sults into components which are searched using div-astar indepen- dently and combined using dynamic programming. div-cut further decomposes the current set of generated results using cut points and combines the results using sophisticated operations. We conducted extensive performance studies using two real datasets, enwiki and reuters. Our div-cut algorithm finds the optimal solution for di- versified top-k search problem in seconds even for k as large as 2, 000.},

abstract = {Result diversity is a topic of great importance as more facets of queries are discovered and users expect to find their desired facets in the first page of the results. However, the underlying questions of how 'diversity' interplays with 'quality' and when preference should be given to one or both are not well-understood. In this work, we model the problem as expectation maximization and study the challenges of estimating the model parameters and reaching an equilibrium. One model parameter, for example, is correlations between pages which we estimate using textual contents of pages and click data (when available). We conduct experiments on diversifying randomly selected queries from a query log and the queries chosen from the disambiguation topics of Wikipedia. Our algorithm improves upon Google in terms of the diversity of random queries, retrieving 14{\%} to 38{\%} more aspects of queries in top 5, while maintaining a precision very close to Google. On a more selective set of queries that are expected to benefit from diversification, our algorithm improves upon Google in terms of precision and diversity of the results, and significantly outperforms another baseline system for result diversification.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a general framework for evaluation and optimization of methods for diversifying query results. In these methods, an initial ranking candidate set produced by a query is used to construct a result set, where elements are ranked with respect to relevance and diversity features, i.e., the retrieved elements should be as relevant as possible to the query, and, at the same time, the result set should be as diverse as possible. While addressing relevance is relatively simple and has been heavily studied, diversity is a harder problem to solve. One major contribution of this paper is that, using the above framework, we adapt, implement and evaluate several existing methods for diversifying query results. We also propose two new approaches, namely the Greedy with Marginal Contribution (GMC) and the Greedy Randomized with Neighborhood Expansion (GNE) methods. Another major contribution of this paper is that we present the first thorough experimental evaluation of the various diversification techniques implemented in a common framework. We examine the methods' performance with respect to precision, running time and quality of the result. Our experimental results show that while the proposed methods have higher running times, they achieve precision very close to the optimal, while also providing the best result quality. While GMC is deterministic, the randomized approach (GNE) can achieve better result quality if the user is willing to tradeoff running time.},

Vega-Lite combines a traditional grammar of graphics, providing visual encoding rules and a composition algebra for layered and multi-view displays, with a novel grammar of interaction. Users specify interactive semantics by composing selections. In Vega-Lite, a selection is an abstraction that defines input event processing, points of interest, and a predicate function for inclusion testing. Selections parameterize visual encodings by serving as input data, defining scale extents, or by driving conditional logic. The Vega-Lite compiler automatically synthesizes requisite data flow and event handling logic, which users can override for further customization. In contrast to existing reactive specifications, Vega-Lite selections decompose an interaction design into concise, enumerable semantic units. We evaluate Vega-Lite through a range of examples, demonstrating succinct specification of both customized interaction methods and common techniques such as panning, zooming, and linked selection.},

abstract = {Conventional query languages such as SQL and MDX have limited formatting and visualization capabilities. Thus, although powerful queries can be composed, another layer of software is needed to report or present the results in a useful form to the analyst. VizQLâ„¢ is designed to fill that gap. VizQL evolved from the Polaris system at Stanford, which combined query, analysis and visualization into a single framework [1].VizQL is a formal language for describing tables, charts, graphs, maps, time series and tables of visualizations. These different types of visual representations are unified into one framework, making it easy to switch from one visual representation to another (e.g. from a list view to a cross-tab to a chart). Unlike current charting packages and like query languages, VizQL permits an unlimited number of picture expressions. Visualizations can thus be easily customized and controlled. VizQL is a declarative language. The desired picture is described; the low-level operations needed to retrieve the results, to perform analytical calculations, to map the results to a visual representation, and to render the image are generated automatically by the query analyzer. The query analyzer compiles VizQL expressions to SQL and MDX and thus VizQL can be used with relational databases and datacubes. The current implementation supports Hyperion Essbase, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Analysis Services, MySQL, Oracle, as well as desktop data sources such as CSV and Excel files. This analysis phase includes many optimizations that allow large databases to be browsed interactively. VizQL enables a new generation of visual analysis tools that closely couple query, analysis and visualization. Copyright 2006 ACM.},

In particular, we discuss results on using information on user eye gaze patterns while interacting with a given visualization to predict the user's visualization tasks, as well as user cognitive abilities including perceptual speed, visual working memory, and verbal working memory. We show that such predictions are significantly better than a baseline classifier even during the early stages of visualization usage.

In our demonstration, conference attendees will see SEEDB in action for a variety of queries on multiple real-world datasets.},

abstract = {When we evaluate the quality of recommender systems (RS), most approaches only focus on the predictive accuracy of these systems. Recent works suggest that beyond accuracy there is a variety of other metrics that should be considered when evaluating a RS. In this paper we focus on two crucial metrics in RS evaluation: coverage and serendipity. Based on a literature review, we first discuss both measurement methods as well as the trade-off between good coverage and serendipity. We then analyze the role of coverage and serendipity as indicators of recommendation quality, present novel ways of how they can be measured and discuss how to interpret the obtained measurements. Overall, we argue that our new ways of measuring these concepts reflect the quality impression perceived by the user in a better way than previous metrics thus leading to enhanced user satisfaction.},

Towards this end, we present AIDE, an Automatic Interactive Data Exploration framework that assists users in discovering new interesting data patterns and eliminate expensive ad-hoc exploratory queries. AIDE relies on a seamless integration of classification algorithms and data management optimization techniques that collectively strive to accurately learn the user interests based on his relevance feedback on strategically collected samples. We present a number of exploration techniques as well as optimizations that minimize the number of samples presented to the user while offering interactive performance. AIDE can deliver highly accurate query predictions for very common conjunctive queries with small user effort while, given a reasonable number of samples, it can predict with high accuracy complex disjunctive queries. It provides interactive performance as it limits the user wait time per iteration of exploration to less than a few seconds.},

abstract = {â€”Exploration over large datasets is a key first step in data analysis, as users may be unfamiliar with the underlying database schema and unable to construct precise queries that represent their interests. Such data exploration task usually involves executing numerous ad-hoc queries, which requires a considerable amount of time and human effort. In this paper, we present REQUEST, a novel framework that is designed to minimize the human effort and enable both effective and efficient data exploration. REQUEST supports the query-from-examples style of data exploration by integrating two key components: 1) Data Reduction, and 2) Query Selection. As instances of the REQUEST framework, we propose several highly scalable schemes, which employ active learning techniques and provide different levels of efficiency and effectiveness as guided by the user's preferences. Our results, on real-world datasets from Sloan Digital Sky Survey, show that our schemes on average require 1-2 orders of magnitude fewer feedback questions than the random baseline, and 3-16Ã— fewer questions than the state-of-the-art, while maintaining interactive response time. Moreover, our schemes are able to construct, with high accuracy, queries that are often undetectable by current techniques.},

abstract = {Data analysts often build visualizations as the first step in their an-alytical workflow. However, when working with high-dimensional datasets, identifying visualizations that show relevant or desired trends in data can be laborious. We propose SEEDB, a visual-ization recommendation engine to facilitate fast visual analysis: given a subset of data to be studied, SEEDB intelligently explores the space of visualizations, evaluates promising visualizations for trends, and recommends those it deems most " useful " or " inter-esting " . The two major obstacles in recommending interesting vi-sualizations are (a) scale: evaluating a large number of candidate visualizations while responding within interactive time scales, and (b) utility: identifying an appropriate metric for assessing interest-ingness of visualizations. For the former, SEEDB introduces prun-ing optimizations to quickly identify high-utility visualizations and sharing optimizations to maximize sharing of computation across visualizations. For the latter, as a first step, we adopt a deviation-based metric for visualization utility, while indicating how we may be able to generalize it to other factors influencing utility. We im-plement SEEDB as a middleware layer that can run on top of any DBMS. Our experiments show that our framework can identify in-teresting visualizations with high accuracy. Our optimizations lead to multiple orders of magnitude speedup on relational row and col-umn stores and provide recommendations at interactive time scales. Finally, we demonstrate via a user study the effectiveness of our deviation-based utility metric and the value of recommendations in supporting visual analytics.},

abstract = {Data visualization plays a crucial role in identifying interesting patterns in exploratory data analysis. Its use is, however, made difficult by the large number of possible data projections showing different attribute subsets that must be evaluated by the data analyst. In this paper, we introduce a method called VizRank, which is applied on classified data to automatically select the most useful data projections. VizRank can be used with any visualization method that maps attribute values to points in a two-dimensional visualization space. It assesses possible data projections and ranks them by their ability to visually discriminate between classes. The quality of class separation is estimated by computing the predictive accuracy of k-nearest neighbor classifier on the data set consisting of x and y positions of the projected data points and their class information. The paper introduces the method and presents experimental results which show that VizRank's ranking of projections highly agrees with subjective rankings by data analysts. The practical use of VizRank is also demonstrated by an application in the field of functional genomics.},

abstract = {â€”To support effective data exploration, there is a well-recognized need for solutions that can automatically rec-ommend interesting visualizations, which reveal useful insights into the analyzed data. However, such visualizations come at the expense of high data processing costs, where a large number of views are generated to evaluate their usefulness. Those costs are further escalated in the presence of numerical dimensional attributes, due to the potentially large number of possible binning aggregations, which lead to a drastic increase in the number of possible visualizations. To address that challenge, in this paper we propose the MuVE scheme for Multi-Objective View Recommendation for Visual Data Exploration. MuVE introduces a hybrid multi-objective utility function, which captures the impact of binning on the utility of visualizations. Consequently, novel algorithms are proposed for the efficient recommendation of data visualizations that are based on numerical dimensions. The main idea underlying MuVE is to incrementally and progressively assess the different benefits provided by a visualization, which allows an early pruning of a large number of unnecessary op-erations. Our extensive experimental results show the significant gains provided by our proposed scheme.},
