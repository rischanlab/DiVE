	abstract = {Data analysts often build visualizations as the first step in their an-alytical workflow. However, when working with high-dimensional datasets, identifying visualizations that show relevant or desired trends in data can be laborious. We propose SEEDB, a visual-ization recommendation engine to facilitate fast visual analysis: given a subset of data to be studied, SEEDB intelligently explores the space of visualizations, evaluates promising visualizations for trends, and recommends those it deems most " useful " or " inter-esting " . The two major obstacles in recommending interesting vi-sualizations are (a) scale: evaluating a large number of candidate visualizations while responding within interactive time scales, and (b) utility: identifying an appropriate metric for assessing interest-ingness of visualizations. For the former, SEEDB introduces prun-ing optimizations to quickly identify high-utility visualizations and sharing optimizations to maximize sharing of computation across visualizations. For the latter, as a first step, we adopt a deviation-based metric for visualization utility, while indicating how we may be able to generalize it to other factors influencing utility. We im-plement SEEDB as a middleware layer that can run on top of any DBMS. Our experiments show that our framework can identify in-teresting visualizations with high accuracy. Our optimizations lead to multiple orders of magnitude speedup on relational row and col-umn stores and provide recommendations at interactive time scales. Finally, we demonstrate via a user study the effectiveness of our deviation-based utility metric and the value of recommendations in supporting visual analytics.},

	abstract = {â€”To support effective data exploration, there is a well-recognized need for solutions that can automatically rec-ommend interesting visualizations, which reveal useful insights into the analyzed data. However, such visualizations come at the expense of high data processing costs, where a large number of views are generated to evaluate their usefulness. Those costs are further escalated in the presence of numerical dimensional attributes, due to the potentially large number of possible binning aggregations, which lead to a drastic increase in the number of possible visualizations. To address that challenge, in this paper we propose the MuVE scheme for Multi-Objective View Recommendation for Visual Data Exploration. MuVE introduces a hybrid multi-objective utility function, which captures the impact of binning on the utility of visualizations. Consequently, novel algorithms are proposed for the efficient recommendation of data visualizations that are based on numerical dimensions. The main idea underlying MuVE is to incrementally and progressively assess the different benefits provided by a visualization, which allows an early pruning of a large number of unnecessary op-erations. Our extensive experimental results show the significant gains provided by our proposed scheme.},

	abstract = {Result diversity is a topic of great importance as more facets of queries are discovered and users expect to find their desired facets in the first page of the results. However, the underlying questions of how 'diversity' interplays with 'quality' and when preference should be given to one or both are not well-understood. In this work, we model the problem as expectation maximization and study the challenges of estimating the model parameters and reaching an equilibrium. One model parameter, for example, is correlations between pages which we estimate using textual contents of pages and click data (when available). We conduct experiments on diversifying randomly selected queries from a query log and the queries chosen from the disambiguation topics of Wikipedia. Our algorithm improves upon Google in terms of the diversity of random queries, retrieving 14{\%} to 38{\%} more aspects of queries in top 5, while maintaining a precision very close to Google. On a more selective set of queries that are expected to benefit from diversification, our algorithm improves upon Google in terms of precision and diversity of the results, and significantly outperforms another baseline system for result diversification.},

@article{Vieira2011,
	abstract = {In this paper we describe a general framework for evaluation and optimization of methods for diversifying query results. In these methods, an initial ranking candidate set produced by a query is used to construct a result set, where elements are ranked with respect to relevance and diversity features, i.e., the retrieved elements should be as relevant as possible to the query, and, at the same time, the result set should be as diverse as possible. While addressing relevance is relatively simple and has been heavily studied, diversity is a harder problem to solve. One major contribution of this paper is that, using the above framework, we adapt, implement and evaluate several existing methods for diversifying query results. We also propose two new approaches, namely the Greedy with Marginal Contribution (GMC) and the Greedy Randomized with Neighborhood Expansion (GNE) methods. Another major contribution of this paper is that we present the first thorough experimental evaluation of the various diversification techniques implemented in a common framework. We examine the methods' performance with respect to precision, running time and quality of the result. Our experimental results show that while the proposed methods have higher running times, they achieve precision very close to the optimal, while also providing the best result quality. While GMC is deterministic, the randomized approach (GNE) can achieve better result quality if the user is willing to tradeoff running time.},

	abstract = {Today, Interactive Data Exploration (IDE) has become a main constituent of many discovery-oriented applications, in which users repeatedly submit exploratory queries to identify interesting subspaces in large data sets. Returning relevant yet diverse results to such queries provides users with quick insights into a rather large data space. Meanwhile, search results diversification adds additional cost to an already computationally expensive exploration process. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel diversification scheme called DivIDE, which targets the problem of efficiently diversifying the results of queries posed during data exploration sessions. In particular, our scheme exploits the properties of data diversification functions while leveraging the natural overlap occurring between the results of different queries so that to provide significant reductions in processing costs. Our extensive experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real data sets shows the significant benefits provided by our scheme as compared to existing methods.},

However, the benefits of diversification are achieved at the expense of an additional cost for the post-processing of query results. For high dimensional large result sets, the cost of diversification is further escalated due to massive distance computations required to evaluate the similarity between results. To address that challenge, in this paper we propose the Progressive Data Diversification (pDiverse) scheme. The main idea underlying pDiverse is to utilize partial distance computation to reduce the amount of processed data.
